# WordPress Plugin Template 
This template uses concepts such as OOP and DI to make everything more "central" in your next WordPress plugin. This is opposed to the "fragmented" way WordPress code is usually developed.

If you're unfamiliar with OOP (object-oriented programming) then I recommend you [read this introduction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_object_oriented.htm).

If you're unfamilair with DI (dependency injection) then I recommend you [read this introduction](http://codeinphp.github.io/post/dependency-injection-in-php/).
